  Graph processing is an increasingly important domain of computer science, with
  applications in data and network analysis, among others. Target graphs in
  these applications are often large, leading to the creating of ``big data''
  systems designed to provide the scalability needed to analyze these graphs
  using parallelism. However, researchers have shown that while these systems
  often provide scalability, they also often introduce overheads that exceed the
  benefits they provide, with lower absolute performance than simple serial
  implementations.

  This report studies the viability and performance of using the actor model to
  perform common graph tasks. We show that relatively simple actor-based
  implementations outperform both dedicated graph processing systems and the
  benchmark serial code.
